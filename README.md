## Minesweeper

Written by Van Boughner as a demonstration of architecture and implementation of a small React project.

Play the game with the [Live Demo](https://vans-minesweeper.netlify.com/)!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the game in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

This project was built using the create-react-app starter.
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc)
right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work,
but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments,
and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Supported Browsers

This project uses the latest version of React.

You can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.
